Originally forked from RestMVC
=======

This fork attempts to update this lib to use latest versions of dependencies. For full info, please got to the original: https://github.com/keithnlarsen/restmvc.js
I've published this on NPM so if you used `npm install restmvc` this is the fork you're using.


RestMVC
=======

The goal of RestMVC is to  provide a simple framework that helps you to write a RESTful webservice using NodeJs, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.  It's goal is to take out the repetitive crap everyone hates doing, while staying out of your ways as much as possible and letting you do things how you want to.

## Contribute

This project is just begining, it arose from my attempts to create a RESTful service and discovering that it wasn't as easy as I would have liked.  Lately it seems this is evolving into Nodejs on Rails... not that I think I could possibly take on that daunting task.  I'd really appreciate any contributions, bug reports, advice, or suggestions for improvement.

## Features

This is the first release, but so far given a mongoose model object it will:

 * Tool to build project skelleton for you
 * Tool to build empty models for you
 * Auto-generate controllers
 * Auto-generate routes
 * Handle 'BadRequest', 'NotFound' and '500' errors in a nice clean way.
 * Inflection Library to translate 'person' into 'people'
 * Accept header based response rendering
 * List will now take '?from=1&to=10' for paging

Planned in the near future:

 * Security.
 * More complex List actions on the controller.
 * Filters
 * More error types.
 
## Installation

    npm install restmvc.js

### Dependancies

So far this is dependant on:

  * Nodejs >= 0.4.1
  * Mongoose 1.3.6
  * MongoDB 1.6.5
  * Express 2.3.7
  * NodeUnit 0.5.0
  * Node-Jake
  * EJS 0.3.1

## Example

I've created an example project in the example folder.  If you download the complete RestMVC.js project and from the command line navigate into the example folder, you can run a set of integration tests by typing:

    jake test

You can also start up the the REST service by typing:

    jake debug

## Setup

A tool is provided to auto-generate a project structure for you.  You can use it by executing the following:

    restmvc app hello

It will generate a project structure for you like this:

    /controllers
    /controllers/{entity_name}.js
    /models
    /models/{entity_name}.js
    /routes
    /routes/{entity_name}.js
    app.js

### Creating a Model

Models are just standard Mongoose models, you can create a new model by creating a javascript file inside of the 'models' folder.  You need to name the file, and the export the same.  Your object will get a Mongoose object passed to it, you use that to create your model.

You can create an empty model by typing the following from the root of the project:

    restmvc model {entity_name}

Here's an example of how you'd define one:

    exports.person = function (mongoose) {
        var schema = mongoose.Schema;

        mongoose.model('Person', new schema({
            firstName: String,
            lastName: String,
            initial: String,
            dateOfBirth: Date
        }));

        return mongoose.model('Person');
    };

### Creating a Controller

You don't have to do anything to create a basic controller, one that provides show, index, insert, update, and destory is reflectively created for you at runtime.  However if you wanted to extend or change the base controller, you'd create a file inside of the 'controllers' folder and name it the same as your model file.  The file should export an object named {entity_name}Controller, for example personController.

Here's an example of how you'd define one:

    module.exports.personController = function(baseController, restMvc){
        return baseController;
    }

From this basic framework a controller is dynamically built for each model object that implements:

  * show(id)
  * index(),
  * index(start, limit),
  * insert(json)
  * update(id, json)
  * remove(id)

You can extend the base functionality by defining your controller something like this:

    module.exports.personController = function(baseController, restMvc){
        //Example of how to extend the base controller if you need to...
        var personController = baseController.extend({
            toString: function(){
                // calls parent "toString" method without arguments
                return this._super(extendedController, "toString") + this.name;
            }
        });

        return personController;
    };

### Routes

The default routes that get added to your express app are:

  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}/                      - Renders Index view of all entities in the colleciton
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}?start=1&limit=10      - Renders Index view of all entities in specified range
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}/New                   - Renders New view to create a new entity
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}.json?start=1&limit=10 - Sends a json list of all entities in specified range
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}.json                  - Sends a json list of all entities in the colleciton
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}/{id}                  - Renders Show view of a specified entity
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}/{id}.json             - Sends json representation of a specified entity
  * GET     /{entity_plural_name}/{id}.json/{Action}    - Renders a view by the name of the {Action} for the specified entity
  * PUT     /{entity_plural_name}/ {FormData}           - Inserts a new record using {FormData} passed in
  * PUT     /{entity_plural_name}/ {JSON}               - Inserts a new record using the {JSON} passed in
  * POST    /{entity_plural_name}/{id} {FormData}       - Updates a record using the {FormData} passed in
  * POST    /{entity_plural_name}/{id} {JSON}           - Updates a record using the {JSON} passed in
  * DELETE  /{entity_plural_name}/{id}                  - Deletes the specified record

You don't need to define a route at all as they are setup for you, but if you want to extend the defaults by defining routes for your entity type, it would look something like the following:

    module.exports.employeeRoutes = function(employeeController, app, restMvc){
        //Example route implemtation.
        app.get('/employees/:id', function(request, response, next) {
            employeeController.get(request.params.id, function(err, instance) {
                if (err)
                    next(new Error('Internal Server Error: see logs for details: ' +  err), request, response);
                else if (!instance)
                    next(restMvc.RestError.NotFound.create('Employee Id: "' + request.params.id + '" was not found.'), request, response);
                else
                    response.send(instance.toObject());
            });
        });
    };

## Initialization

In your app.js file after connecting to mongoose and defining your express app, you should initialize everything like so:

    var express = require('express');
    var restMVC = require('restmvc.js');
    var mongoose = require('mongoose');

    var app = module.exports = express.createServer();

    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/restmvc');

    ... a bunch of standard app configuration junk ...

    restMVC.Initialize(app, mongoose);

    app.error(restMVC.ErrorHandler);

    if (!module.parent) {
        app.listen(3000);
        console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/' + '\r');
    }

You can then start your sever using app.listen...

## Customize RestErrors

So far only two errors are handled, 400 and 404.  If you want to extend this, it is very easy to do.  Just do something like this in your app.js file.

    // Add a custom rest error for Forbidden
    restMVC.RestError.Forbidden = restMVC.RestError.BaseRestError.extend({
        name: 'Forbidden',
        title: 'Forbidden',
        description: 'Access denied.',
        httpStatus: 403
    })

You can just let the default error template generate the html response, or you can define a customer one like so:

    // Add a custom handler for Forbidden
    restMVC.ErrorMapper['Forbidden'] = function(error, request, response){
        response.render('resterror.jade', {
            status: error.httpStatus,
            error: error
        });
    }

## API

RestMVC make all the models, controllers, and RestErrors junk available to you via the following:

  * restMVC.Models[] - all your models are available here by name, such as: var personModel = restMVC.Models['person'];
  * restMVC.Controllers[] - all your controllers are available here by name, such as: var personController = restMVC.Controllers['person'];
  * restMVC.RestError - the RestError infrastructure is available to you here for customization.
  * restMVC.BaseRestError - use this to extend the default error handling and create new types of RestErrors (based of standard http status codes of course)
  * restMVC.ErrorMapper - this defines what the error handler does when it gets passed a particular error.
  * restMVC.ErrorHandler - this is used by the Express app to handle the errors, actually you have to wire this up by doing: app.error(restMVC.ErrorHandler);
  * restMVC.Initialize(app, mongoose) - This is what kicks off everything, called by you in your app.js file.
  * restMVC.BaseController - This is the base controller that all others are created from, exposed for testing purposes.
  * restMVC.RegisterRoutes(app, controller) - Registers the default routes for the default controller, exposed for testing purposes.
